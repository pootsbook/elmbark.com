I started sending out the **Elm Weekly** email newsletter in February 2016 as a way to help people keep up-to-date with what’s happening in the Elm community. 

You can sign up at [www.elmweekly.nl](http://www.elmweekly.nl).

Sometimes people ask me why I chose the _.nl_ domain, it helps that I’m now resident in the Netherlands of course, but primarily I thought **nl** was a good fit for **n**ews**l**etter (and the _.com_ was taken).
